# üìå Problem

* In the contemporary digital era, communication is predominantly facilitated through text-based mediums such as **instant messaging, email, social media and static images**. This shift has created a significant **‚Äúemotional ambiguity‚Äù** gap,
  
*  as digital communication lacks essential non-verbal cues like vocal tone, body language, and real-time facial expressions that are crucial for accurate emotional understanding. Many daily notetakers, for instance, write about their day, good or bad situations, personal reflections, or emotional experiences without an effective way to analyse their underlying emotions over time. 
  
*  when people communicate through platforms like **`WhatsApp or Facebook`**, it can be difficult to determine the other person‚Äôs true emotional state, which may lead to confusion or misunderstandings. 
  
* **The same challenge exists with images**, where understanding a person‚Äôs emotion at a specific moment is often unclear. Therefore, there is a growing need for an intelligent system capable of detecting and analysing emotions from both text and images to enhance emotional awareness and digital empathy. 


# üí° Solution

* The project is a **Mobile application powered by NLP and Deep Learning techniques** to analyse the user's psychological state and emotions.

* The application will operate not only on the text the user types, but also on **facial expressions using the camera**. The goal is for the application to accurately **understand the user's psychological state** and provide practical suggestions to assist the user in their daily life, analyse the emotion of user's emotions over time, helping them to understand their messages to avoid misunderstandings


This will allow users to avoid misunderstandings in chats, gain personal awareness, and even reflect on long-term emotional patterns.

# üîë Features

* Detect emotion from personal notes.
* Upload an image to analyze the **emotion of a person** in it.
* Track and analyze historical emotional patterns.

# üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

* **Frontend:** Dart (Flutter)
* **Backend & ML:** Python (TensorFlow, NLTK, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy)
