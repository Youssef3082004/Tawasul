# 📌 Problem

* In the **contemporary digital era**, personal reflection is predominantly facilitated through text-based mediums such as digital notes, journal entries, and static images. This reliance on text has created a significant **“emotional ambiguity”** gap, as standard digital records lack essential non-verbal cues, like vocal tone and facial expressions, that are crucial for quantifying mental well-being.
  
* Many daily notetakers document their days, personal reflections, and experiences, yet they lack an effective tool to analyze the underlying emotions of these entries over time. Without this analysis, it is difficult for users to track their true emotional state or identify patterns in their mood, leading to missed opportunities for self-improvement.
  
* **The same challenge exists with images**, where the emotional context of a photo is often unclear or forgotten. Therefore, there is a growing need for an intelligent system capable of detecting and analyzing emotions from both text and images to enhance emotional awareness and digital empathy towards oneself.


# 💡 Solution

* The project is a **smart mobile journaling application powered by NLP and Deep Learning techniques**, designed to analyze the user's psychological state and emotional well-being.

* Unlike standard text diaries, the application operates multimodally: it analyzes the sentiment of the text the user types in their entries and detects emotional cues from facial expressions using the camera during a photo. The goal is for the application to accurately interpret the user's psychological state and **provide practical, personalized suggestions** to assist them in their daily life. By tracking these emotional patterns over time, the application helps users gain deep self-awareness, allowing them to identify their own internal triggers and fluctuations rather than just recording daily events.

This will allow users to gain profound personal awareness, uncover hidden stress triggers, and reflect on long-term emotional patterns to improve their overall mental well-being.
