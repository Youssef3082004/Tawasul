### 📌 Problem

As a **noter**, I often write notes about my day in a notes application, whether good or bad situations. However:

* It’s difficult to **determine my emotions** from what I write, which makes it harder to track my psychological state over time.
* When chatting with someone on **WhatsApp or Facebook**, it’s not always clear what the other person’s emotion is. Misinterpretations can lead to **confusion or conflicts**.
